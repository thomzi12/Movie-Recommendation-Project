# Movie-Recommendation-Project
An email recommendation system built with Python as the final project for Udacity Python programming course. 

1.	The class structure for this program is in Video.py. That being said, you will want to execute the code in Reader.py to start the program. AFI.csv and GT.csv should be in the same folder as the Python scripts. 
2.	Make sure the .csv locations written in the program make sense when you run it – or else, you’ll have no class instances and not much of a program!
3.	Once you run Reader.py, the console will prompt you for your gmail email and password. This is needed to send you an email with film and Talks at Google recommendations!
4.	WAIT a couple seconds until the console reads "Done! Just a minute until the email appears in your inbox ...". The email will be on its way!
5.	Check your inbox for the program email. What recommendations did you get?
6.	Sit back and enjoy! Enlighten yourself with a popular Talk at Google or a film that the American Film Institute has deemed one of the best of the twentieth century.
